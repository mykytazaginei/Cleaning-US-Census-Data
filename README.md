# Cleaning-US-Census-Data
Let's imagine that I'm hired as a data analyst at the Census Bureau, where my responsibilities include collecting census data and creating meaningful visualizations from it. The previous person in this role left behind a collection of recent census data stored in several CSV files. Instead of using pandas, they manually traversed these CSV files whenever data analysis was required. Sometimes they resorted to copying and pasting certain numbers into Excel to create charts.

The prospect of continuing this manual approach is daunting and lacks scalability and repeatability. To solve this problem, my boss tasked me with converting this data into pandas format and organizing it into a more structured form. This will allow me to efficiently create scatterplots at the end of the day, providing a more streamlined and automated process for future analysis.
